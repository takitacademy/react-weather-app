## Challenge Project: React Weather App

### Description:

The goal of this challenge is to create a weather application using React, Hooks, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript. The application will fetch weather data from an API and display it to the user in a visually appealing and user-friendly manner.

### Requirements:

- Fetch weather data: Implement a function to fetch weather data from a weather API (such as OpenWeatherMap or WeatherAPI) using an HTTP request. Use the Axios library for making the request.

- Display current weather: Create a component to display the current weather conditions, including the temperature, weather description, and an icon representing the weather condition.

- Search functionality: Implement a search feature where users can enter the name of a city and retrieve the corresponding weather data. Use a text input field and handle the form submission event to fetch weather data for the entered city.

- Display forecast: Create a component to display the forecast for the next few days. Show the date, temperature, and weather condition for each day. The forecast should be responsive and adjust based on the screen size.

- Styling with Tailwind CSS: Use Tailwind CSS classes to style your components and create a visually appealing layout. Consider using responsive design principles to make your application mobile-friendly.

- TypeScript typings: Use TypeScript to add type annotations to your components, functions, and API responses. Ensure that your code is type-safe and handles potential errors or missing data.

- Error handling: Handle potential errors that may occur during API requests or when data is missing or invalid. Display appropriate error messages to the user when necessary.

- Extra features (optional): Add extra features to enhance your application, such as a toggle for switching between Celsius and Fahrenheit, geolocation to automatically fetch weather data for the user's location, or an hourly forecast.

### Submission Guidelines:

- Create a GitHub repository to host your project.
- Provide clear instructions in the repository's README on how to run the application.
- Ensure your code is well-structured, organized, and follows best practices.
- Include comments and documentation to explain your code and any design decisions.
- Add a demo or screenshots showcasing the functionality of your weather app.

### Evaluation Criteria:

- Successful implementation of the above requirements.
- Code organization, clarity, and adherence to best practices.
- Proper usage of React Hooks and functional components.
- Correct implementation of TypeScript typings.
- Effective error handling and user feedback.
- Responsive design and thoughtful use of Tailwind CSS classes.
- Extra features and enhancements (if implemented).


Note: This challenge project is designed to be beginner-friendly and covers the core concepts of React with Hooks, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript.
